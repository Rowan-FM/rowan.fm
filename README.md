# Personal Website

## Overview

This is my personal website created for the purpose of professional promotion. It is a single-page static HTML site built with the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) front-end toolkit and published to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using a custom domain (<https://rowan.fm/>).

## Third-Party Resources Used

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (v5.3.5): front-end toolkit used for layout and styling, ensures consistent and responsive layout rendering across all devices.
- [mononoki](https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/): custom monospace font created by [Matthias Tellen](https://github.com/madmalik), chosen for aesthetics and to avoid rendering issues related to poor-quality monospace system fonts on Android.
